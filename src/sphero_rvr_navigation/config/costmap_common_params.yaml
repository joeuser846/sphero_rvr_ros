# http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/flat
# The default maximum distance from the robot at which an obstacle will be inserted into the cost map in meters.
# This can be over-ridden on a per-sensor basis.

# The default range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data.

# The footprint of the robot specified in the robot_base_frame coordinate frame as a list in the format: 
# [ [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...., [xn, yn] ]. The footprint specification assumes the center point of the robot is at 
# (0.0, 0.0) in the robot_base_frame and that the points are specified in meters, 
# both clockwise and counter-clockwise orderings of points are supported.
footprint: [[-0.11, -0.10], [-0.11, 0.10], [0.11, 0.10], [0.11, -0.10]]
